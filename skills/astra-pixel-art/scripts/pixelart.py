"""pixelart — draw pixel art from the command line, in steps.

Everything this program needs is in the standard library, so there is no
environment to create and no package to install.  Draw by sending Python
snippets to ``exec``; each snippet is appended to a log that is replayed on
every call, so variables and canvases survive between steps without any
server or kernel process.

A step is one Python snippet, sent on stdin (or with ``--file``).  The whole
log is replayed before the new snippet runs, so anything a step bound — a
canvas, a variable, a registered colour — is still in scope in the next one.

Two rules keep replay honest: steps must be deterministic (use ``rng()``
instead of ``random``) and must not have side effects other than drawing
(a step that downloads or writes files outside the workspace will do it
again on every replay).

ASTRA PIXEL ART — everything you can call inside a step. Nothing to import.

HOW A STEP RUNS
  `exec` replays every step so far, then runs yours; anything you bind
  (variables, imports, canvases) is still there in the next step. print()
  output comes back to you.
  A step that raises is NOT stored and leaves the drawing untouched — fix it
  and run again. There is nothing to clean up after a failure.
  Steps are replayed, so keep them deterministic (no random, no wall-clock)
  and free of side effects (no downloads, installs, or writes outside the
  workspace). Put work like that in its own command, not in a drawing step.
  Errors raise CanvasError with a message naming the fix.

CANVASES — a canvas is a layer; make one per element, composite at the end
  new_canvas(w, h, background=None, name=None) -> Canvas
      Nothing is pre-created: you choose the size. Transparent unless
      `background` is given, in which case it is filled with that colour.
      Auto-named c1, c2, ...
  canvas(ref=0) -> Canvas
      By name, by index, -1 for the newest, or a Canvas object you already
      hold. Selecting one also makes it the current canvas, which save() and
      view() default to.
  current() -> Canvas
      The canvas those two are defaulting to, without selecting anything.
  canvases() -> [{name, size, colors, current}, ...]
  flatten([layers...], name=None, background=None) -> Canvas
      Composite bottom-to-top into a NEW canvas, source-over: an opaque
      pixel hides what is below, a fully transparent one is ignored, and a
      part-transparent one blends with it. Any blended colour is registered
      in the palette like every other colour. Layers must all be the same
      size. Transparent areas let lower layers show through, which is how you
      cut holes.
  load(path, name=None, add=True) -> Canvas
      From a .pixelart.json state file or a PNG; relative paths resolve
      against the workspace. add=True (default) makes it a layer of the
      drawing; add=False only reads the file — inspecting a preview or
      checking a size — without it joining the picture.
  c.copy(name=None) -> Canvas
      Duplicate a canvas; it shares the palette.

DRAWING — every call returns the canvas it drew on, so calls chain:
    c.set(x, y, colour).line(x0, y0, x1, y1, colour)
  Every shape FILLS by default; fill=False outlines instead. Coordinates are
  0-indexed, origin top-left, y grows DOWN. Drawing outside the canvas is
  clipped silently, not an error. Sizes are inclusive: rect(x, y, w, h) covers
  w x h pixels, and a circle of radius r is 2r+1 pixels across (r=3 -> 7px).
  c.set(x, y, colour)                          one pixel
  c.rect(x, y, w, h, colour, fill=True)        w/h are the SIZE, not the far
        corner; both must be positive
  c.line(x0, y0, x1, y1, colour)               Bresenham, both ends included
  c.circle(cx, cy, r, colour, fill=True)
  c.ellipse(cx, cy, rx, ry, colour, fill=True)
  c.poly([(x, y), ...], colour, fill=True)     even-odd fill; >= 2 points
  c.path(d, colour, fill=True)                 curves, arcs and multi-part
        outlines as SVG path data:
        M L H V C S Q T A Z; upper case
        absolute, lower case relative,
        repeated numbers repeat the
        command. fill=True fills every
        subpath as ONE even-odd region,
        so a second subpath cuts a hole;
        fill=False strokes them open and
        only Z closes. Path data only -
        no transform, viewBox or style.
  c.text(x, y, s, colour, spacing=None, font=None)
        one line of text. "5x7" is
        ASCII at 5x7; "8px", "10px" and
        "12px" are three sizes of the CJK
        font, and they are not
        interchangeable (the reference
        lists what each one covers).
        font=None picks by content: ASCII
        uses 5x7, anything outside ASCII
        uses 12px. spacing=None keeps the
        font's own default.
  c.fill_at(x, y, colour)                      four-connected flood fill
  c.clear(x=0, y=0, w=None, h=None)            erase to transparent;
        defaults to the whole canvas
  c.blit(other_canvas, dx, dy)                 stamp a canvas; transparent
        pixels are skipped
  c.mirror(axis="h")                           "h" or "v", in place
  c.shift(dx, dy, fill=None)                   move everything; vacated pixels
        take `fill` (default transparent)
  c.outline(colour)                            repaint visible pixels touching
        transparency — the quick way to
        make a sprite read on any
        background
  c.dither(x, y, w, h, [a, b], pattern="checker")
        "checker" or "bayer4"; two
        colours faking a third tone

SELECTIONS — rectangle snapshots; source pixels change only on paste
  c.select(x,y,w,h) -> Selection     integer rectangle, entirely in bounds
  s.flip(axis="h") -> Selection     toggle horizontal "h" or vertical "v"
  s.resize(width,height) -> Selection   absolute positive pre-rotation size
  s.rotate(angle,algorithm="nearest") -> Selection
      Absolute clockwise degrees; nearest or optional "rotsprite" (8x
      Scale2x then rotate/sample). Multiples of 90 are exact permutations.
      Every recipe samples the original snapshot in flip/resize/rotate order;
      resize/rotate replace parameters, flip toggles. Keep the returned object.
  s.size -> (width,height)           expanded rotation bounds
  s.preview(name=None) -> Canvas     detached; shares palette, not a new layer
  s.copy_to(x,y,canvas=None,mode="replace") -> Canvas
  s.move_to(x,y,canvas=None,mode="replace") -> Canvas
      Absolute top-left of expanded output, clipped to destination (default
      source). Replace includes selected transparent pixels; "over" blends.
      Corners outside rotated selection do not erase. Move clears the original
      rectangle, handles overlap, and rejects a changed source; reselect after
      moving. Copy retains the original snapshot even if source pixels change.
      No anti-aliasing/new RGBA in transforms. Arbitrary angles/downscaling may
      lose detail. Each raster, including the 8x intermediate, <= 16777216 pixels.

COLOURS — one palette per drawing, shared by every canvas
  c.color(spec, name=None) -> index
      `spec` is '#rrggbb', '#rgb', '#rrggbbaa' or an (r, g, b[, a]) tuple and
      is registered if new; it may also be the name of a colour already
      registered, or an index, to look one up. The same RGBA always reuses its
      palette entry. Naming an existing colour with a different value raises.
  c.palette() -> [{index, name, rgba}, ...]
  c.color_name(index) -> str          the registered name, else the hex
  c.get(x, y) -> index                palette index (0 = transparent);
                                      bounds-checked, unlike the drawing calls
  A colour reference is a registered name, an index, '#rrggbb', an
  (r, g, b[, a]) tuple, or None / "transparent" to ERASE. Drawing REPLACES
  the pixel, alpha included; alpha blends with flatten(), blit(), or selection paste mode="over",
  and lands in the PNG as it stands.

LOOKING AT THE RESULT — you cannot see a PNG unless you open it
  view(canvas=None, scale=None, size=None, margin=None, edges="tl") -> path
      Renders the canvas to previews/<canvas>@<spec>.png and returns the path.
      Four independent choices:
        size    None = long edge to 512, the size a vision module expects
                (this is the one to use). N = long edge to N, bigger or
                smaller. (w, h) = deliver into that exact frame, fitted
                without distortion and centred.
        scale   N = render exactly N times bigger instead. Pass scale or
                size, not both.
        margin  None = the margin that tested best (see below); 0 = none at
                all; N = exactly N canvas pixels.
        edges   where the margin goes: "tl" (default), "all", "none", or any
                of t/l/b/r.
      To look at your own work: view() — padding, then 512. Nothing to pass.
      Scaling uses nearest neighbour, so going smaller drops pixels rather
      than blurring them. Each variant gets its own file, so you can render
      several and compare them.
      Open the returned path with your image tool, if you have one — writing
      the file is not looking at it, and with no image reading the thing to
      read is matrix_text() below.

  THE MARGIN IS DELIBERATE
      One sixteenth of the long edge - 16->1px, 32->2px, 64->4px - and
      nothing at 512 or more. margin=0 is the comparison case.
      It is a viewing aid: save() never pads and coordinates do not change.

  c.stats() -> dict          size, colours used, visible pixels (alpha > 0),
                             coverage, bbox, top colours
  c.stats_text() -> str      one line: the cheap check after every change
  c.matrix_text(region=None, indices=False) -> str
      The pixels as characters plus a legend naming every colour shown, with
      its hex value and palette index — the fallback when you cannot read
      images. A letter means the same colour in every view of this drawing,
      so two dumps can be compared. `region` is (x0, y0, x1, y1) inclusive;
      keep it small, a 64x64 dump is 64 lines. indices=True puts the indices
      in the grid instead of characters, when you need exact numbers.

OUTPUT — what lands on disk
  save(name, canvas=None, scales=(1,4), indexed=False) -> {png, png_4x, state}
      Writes <name>.png (1x = one file pixel per canvas pixel), <name>@4x.png
      (4x nearest neighbour, no interpolation) and <name>.pixelart.json into
      <workspace>/exports/. Both PNGs by default. Overwrites silently, so
      re-save after every change.
      A name may carry a directory: relative stays under exports/
      ("scenes/cat" -> exports/scenes/cat.png), absolute goes where it says.
      Keep exports in the workspace unless the user asked for another
      location, and tell them the paths you wrote.
  export(name, format="ase") -> path
      The whole drawing as a layered document for another editor: one layer
      per canvas, bottom first, names and palette included, nothing
      flattened or padded. format "ase" is Aseprite (.ase/.aseprite); "ora"
      is OpenRaster (.ora), read by Krita, GIMP and MyPaint. Layered output
      is always RGBA, so no 256-colour limit; every layer has to be the size
      the drawing started at. Same directory rules as save().
  PNG only, both directions; other input formats need Pillow, not installed.
  Files are non-interlaced and transparency is kept. The default is 8-bit
  RGBA, so the colours are baked in and any reader works;
  save(name, indexed=True) writes an indexed PNG instead (the palette travels
  in the file and it is smaller past ~32x32, but at most 256 colours — it
  raises above that).
  <name>.pixelart.json holds the palette and every canvas; load() reads both
  formats back. view() is for looking, not shipping.

STEPPING BACK
  c.snapshot("before") / c.restore("before")    one canvas, within one step;
         restore raises if the name is
         unknown
